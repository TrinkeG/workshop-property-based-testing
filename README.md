# Property based testing workshop

Property based testing is a way to stochastically generate test data.

It can be used for at least two things:

- To really pry into the edge-cases of a system
- To investigate where a bug exists in a pre-existing complex system

There may be more use cases, but this is what we're gonna focus on today.

## Requirements

The following are what I've confirmed it to work on. It may well work on lower versions or higher versions. If you succesfully use a version outside these requirements, please let me know and I'll add it

- node v12.13.1
- npm v6.12.1

You should be comfortable writing code in typescript and comfortable using jest assertions.

It would also help to have some knowledge of how recursion works

## Getting started

`npm install`

## Exercises

In the `exercises` directory, you'll find a number of exercises along with their solutions split into several directories. Each has its own README.md and the tests for each can be run with `npm run ex-{x}`. Please head over to `exercise-1` to get started

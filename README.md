# Property based testing workshop

Property based testing is a way to stochastically generate test data.

It can be used for at least two things:
- To really pry into the edge-cases of a system
- To investigate where a bug exists in a pre-existing complex system

There may be more use cases, but this is what we're gonna focus on today.

## Requirements

The following are what I've confirmed it to work on. It may well work on lower versions or higher versions. If you succesfully use a version outside these requirements, please let me know and I'll add it

- node v12.13.1
- npm v6.12.1

## Instructions

`npm install`
`npm test` - to run all your tests

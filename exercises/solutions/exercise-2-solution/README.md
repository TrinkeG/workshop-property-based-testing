# Exercise 2 - Reversing a list

Solution was to return when the array length is less than 1. If you return when it's less than 3, you end up just returning a small array in the same order it was was given to you in

## Bonus points

A sorting algorithm has the following properties

- A sorted array is the same length as the original array
- When sorting a sorted array, the array doesn't change (sorting is idempotent)
- A sorted array contains all the same objects as the original
